Quick How To
============

Note: it is advised to fork this projec to save your own settings

* Clone in your ``Package/User`` directory::

  $ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User
  $ git clone https://github.com/Stibbons/sublime-user-config.git

* Install Package Control. See:

    https://packagecontrol.io/installation

* Restart sublime.

* Sublime will automatically install new plugins.

* Several crash might occurs. Just keep on restarting sublime when frozen

* settings files might be rewritten. Execute git reset to reset to the latest version commited
  and restart sublime.

    git reset --hard HEAD

* do this until sublime works!


Advice: Commit your change in the settings like you would when developing a software. It will
be very useful in case of plugin crash, freeze, etc. Settings are software too!!!
